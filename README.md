## Case Study: Investigating Increased Critical Potassium Alerts at Clinic3

The pathology laboratory at a hospitalâ€”servicing four offsite ambulatory clinics (Clinic1, Clinic2, Clinic3, and Clinic4)â€”received a notification from a **Clinic3 clinician** reporting a **notable rise in critical potassium values** over recent weeks.

To address this concern, the **laboratory leadership** assigned one of their fellows to collaborate with the **Data Analytics Team** to:

1. **Validate the observation** from Clinic3 and confirm whether there is indeed a rise in critical potassium values.
2. **Investigate potential causes** behind any confirmed increases in critical value incidents.

### Data Context

You are provided with **potassium values and related  data from May 2022 for all four clinics** â€” the period when clinicians from **Clinic 3** reported a spike in critical values.
